### My journey as I unravel ClojureScript

Run `rlwrap lein figwheel`.

**Todo:** Find a better in-line evaluator for Emacs! The CIDER jack-in works for Clojure, but currently is broken for ClojureScript. [Maybe look into Chocolatier?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImsbAiDoEk8)

06/16/17: Right now transducers totally have my attention, but I've only begun to wrap my mind around reducer fns. Will be fun to see how my understanding changes.
